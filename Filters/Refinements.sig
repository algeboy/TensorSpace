S,Refine,"Returns a refinement of the totally ordered filter F and a sequence cataloging the refinements used and which bimaps were used. Set Iterations to a positive integer to set the cutoff on the number of iterations. Otherwise, set to 0, which is the default. Set the sequence Heuristics to allow the kinds of heuristics the algorithm uses. The default includes everything",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Flt,,Flt,82,-38,-38,-38,-38
