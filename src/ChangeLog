June 5, 2017
  - Fixed bugs with HeisenbergGroup and HeisenbergGroupPC.
  - Added intrinsic SliceAsMatrices which essentially combines Slice and 
    AsMatrices.
  - Fixed issues with pCentralTensor.
  - Updated file structure.

June 2, 2017
  - Changed license to GNU GPLv3
  - Fixed a bug in IsNondegenerate, reported by JBW.

May 25, 2017
  - Added intrinsic IsHomotopism. 

May 19, 2017
  - Added all intrinsics to documentation. 
  - Homotopism bug fixed.

May 18, 2017
  - Updated documentation.

May 9, 2017
  - Updated license, README, and added instrinsic 'eMAGmaVersion'.
  - Added functionality for tensors and tensor spaces whose frame contains a 
    0-dimensional space. 
  - Added 'T!0' as a shortcut to get the trivial tensor of a tensor space.

May 8, 2017
  - Fixed a valence bug with Shuffle.

May 3, 2017
  - Black-box tensor constructors return TenSpcElt, TenSpcElt, Hmtp. That is, 
    the tensor (over vector spaces), the given tensor, and a homotopism from the
    given tensor TO the tensor over vector spaces. We may remove the last two 
    outputs at a later date.
  - Fixed a bug with StructureConstants.

April 29, 2017
  - Removed TensorOnVectorSpaces. Now black-box tensors go through this function
    internally, so such a tensor is returned over vector spaces. 
  - Fixed a bug with TensorOverCentroid.
  - Fixed a bug when printing homotopisms.
  - Homotopisms now go through a verification process. This can be skipped with 
    the optional parameter 'Check:=false'.
  - Added '.' functionality to homotopisms.

December 20, 2016
  - Fixed a few bugs.

December 19, 2016
  - Fixed valence issue with IsFullyNondegenerate.

December 11, 2016
  - Valence is now the number of modules in the frame. 
  - Added 'RandomCotensor.'

December 8, 2016
  - HeisenbergGroup now outputs a matrix group (GrpMat). To get a pc-group, use
    HeisenbergGroupPC, this is the old instrinsic with a more fitting name.

December 4, 2016
  - Included more verbose commands.

November 21, 2016
  - When creating a tensor from algebras (e.g. CommutatorTensor), the tensor on
    vector spaces is returned, along with a map from the algebra to the vector
    space.

September 26, 2016
  - Removed 'RecognizeStarAlgebra' from 'AdjointAlgebra' (TenSpcElt version).

August 6, 2016
  - Removed TensorAut.m from spec file. 

July 17, 2016
  - Added PseudoIsometryGroup for TenSptElt. It will attempt to use the
    intrinsic in SmallGenus first. Otherwise it will brute-force search if the
    field is finite. Only one shortcut is taken: we search through the
    normalizer of the isometry group. 
  - Added error messages concerning the tensor category. The direction of the 
    arrows and dimensions of the modules must respect the repeat partitions.

July 16, 2016
  - Added IsometryGroup for TenSpcElt. It will attempt to use the intrinsic
    in StarAlg first. Otherwise it will brute-force search if the field is
    finite.
  - Moved the bimap record format to Types.m.
  - Moved 'Adjoint' attribute into the bimap record, and included Isom, PIsom,
    and Aut in the record as well. 

June 30, 2016
  - TensorOverCentroid now properly returns a tensor in the same category as
    the one given.

June 13, 2016
  - Fixed a discrepenacy with HomotopismCategory when Contravariant is set to 
    true.
  - Allowed for users to make cotensors from a matrix or a sequence with one 
    matrix.

June 10, 2016
  - KTensorSpace allows for nonnegative entries now. 
  - Included a verbose command: Multilinear, 1.
  - Improved the performance of 'Image' of a tensor.

June 7, 2016
  - Fixed a bug with SubConstructor and QuoConstructor with tensor spaces. 
  - Quotients and subspaces of tensor spaces now return maps.
  - Improved some error messages.
  - Depreciating 'SubtensorSpace' and 'Quotient' to be replaced by sub< ... >
    and quo< ... > or '/'.

June 3, 2016
  - Added constructor for RngUPolRes (quotients of univariate poly rings).

June 2, 2016
  - Fixed a bug with signatured tensor spaces.
  - Added more informative error messages.

May 31, 2016
  - pCentralTensor returns the 3 maps from the group into the vector space.
  - Added intrinsic pCentralTensor( G::GrpPC ) this defaults to 
    pCentralTensor(G,1,1).
  - Included informative error messages for the black-box tensor constructions.
    In particular, if the function does not evaluate to the given codomain, an
    error message will be given.
